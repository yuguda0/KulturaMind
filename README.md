## Architecture

### RAG Pipeline

The Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline combines:

1. **Vector Search**: Semantic retrieval using ASI:One embeddings (top_k=10 for comprehensive context)
2. **Semantic Filtering**: LLM-based relevance filtering
3. **Knowledge Graph Reasoning**: MeTTa inference for relationship discovery
4. **Web Enrichment**: Mandatory Wikipedia and web source integration for enriched responses
5. **Response Generation**: ASI:One LLM generates contextual responses (max_tokens=800 for detailed answers)

**Response Quality Improvements**:
- Increased context window (top_k=10) for more comprehensive information retrieval
- Mandatory web enrichment ensures responses are grounded in verified sources
- Enhanced system prompt ensures informative responses without "I don't know" fallbacks
- Larger token budget (800 tokens) enables detailed, nuanced explanations
